# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Managing Website Deployments using Vercel

---

## Overview
This SOP provides detailed steps for accessing, monitoring, and managing website deployments using Vercel. The platform allows seamless integration with GitHub for managing deployments of websites such as Salawat Site, Manifest Mercy, and Salawat Dashboard.

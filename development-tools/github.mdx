# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Managing Code and Adding Collaborators on GitHub

---

## Overview
This SOP provides a detailed guide for accessing the code repositories for the Salawat Dashboard, Salawat Site, and Manifest Mercy on GitHub. It also covers adding collaborators and running local development environments.

---

## Scope
This SOP applies to administrators, developers, and team members managing code repositories for Celebrate Mercyâ€™s projects hosted on GitHub.

---

## Responsibilities
- **Administrators**: Manage access and permissions for code repositories.
- **Developers**: Update and maintain code, as well as perform local development tasks.
- **Support Staff**: Facilitate onboarding of new collaborators.

---

## Requirements
- Access to [GitHub](https://github.com).
- Credentials for `developer@celebratemercy.com`.
- Basic knowledge of GitHub repositories and local development.

---

## Process

### 1. Accessing GitHub
1. Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. Click **Sign In**.
3. Log in using the credentials: `developer@celebratemercy.com`.
4. After logging in, the GitHub dashboard for Celebrate Mercy will appear.

---

### 2. Navigating the GitHub Dashboard
1. On the left-hand side, view the list of repositories:
   - **Docs**: Contains documentation code.
   - **Salawat Site**: Code for the main Salawat website.
   - **Salawat Dashboard**: Code for the dashboard.
   - **Manifest Mercy**: Code for the Manifest Mercy project.
2. Click on a repository (e.g., **Salawat Site**) to access its contents.

---

### 3. Understanding the Repository Layout
1. The repository page includes:
   - **Code Files**: Located under the repository name.
   - **README File**: Provides instructions for local development.
2. To perform local development:
   - Follow the steps outlined in the **README**:
     - Run the command to install the necessary software for the repository.
     - Start the local development environment using the provided command.
   - Access the local version of the site at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

### 4. Adding Collaborators
1. Navigate to the repository settings:
   - Click the **Settings** tab at the top of the repository page.
2. Under **Settings**, select **Collaborators** or **Manage Access**.
3. To add a new collaborator:
   - Click **Add People**.
   - Enter the email address of the individual to invite.
   - Send the invite link to their email.
4. Once the invite is accepted, the collaborator will gain access to the repository and can edit the code as needed.

---

### 5. Running Local Development
1. Follow these steps for local development:
   - Open a terminal window on your computer.
   - Run the command provided in the **README** to install the necessary software.
   - Execute the next command to start the local server.
2. Access the local environment:
   - Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
   - View and test the local version of the Salawat site or dashboard.

---

### 6. Best Practices
- **Manage Access Securely**:
  - Add only authorized individuals as collaborators.
  - Review and revoke access for unused accounts regularly.
- **Document Changes**:
  - Ensure all updates are documented in the repository to maintain transparency.
- **Use Local Development**:
  - Test changes in the local environment before pushing updates to the live site.

---

### 7. Troubleshooting
- **Access Issues**:
  - Verify login credentials for `developer@celebratemercy.com`.
  - Ensure collaborators accept the invite email.
- **Local Development Problems**:
  - Ensure all software dependencies are installed.
  - Check the **README** file for troubleshooting commands.

4. Log in using the GitHub credentials for the Salawat development account (`developer@celebratemercy.com`).

### 2. Navigating the Supabase Interface
1. On the homepage, you will see two databases:
   - **Manifest Mercy**
   - **Salawat Site**
2. Click on the **Salawat Site** database to view data related to Salawat’s Site.

---

### 3. Using the Table Editor
1. Select the **Table Editor** tab to access and manage tables.
2. View the available tables, such as:
   - **Campaigns Table**: Contains data on all campaigns for Salawat’s Site.
   - **Organizations Table**: Contains data on organizations linked to the site.
   - **Pledges Table**: Includes all pledges made through the site.
   - **Settings Table**: Displays site configuration details.

---

### 4. Viewing and Editing Data
1. Select a table to view its contents, organized like a spreadsheet.
2. For minor updates:
   - Click on a cell to edit directly (e.g., update an organization’s logo by entering a new S3 bucket link).
3. Avoid making significant changes directly in the database unless necessary.
4. Use the Salawat Dashboard for most data updates to ensure consistency.

### 5. Understanding Table Relationships
1. **Campaigns Table**:
   - Contains campaign-specific data.
   - Links to other tables via the **campaign ID** column.
2. Example:
   - Data with campaign ID `1` in the **Pledges Table** corresponds to the campaign with ID `1` in the **Campaigns Table**.
3. Other tables reference this structure for organized data linkage.

### 6. Exporting Data
1. To export data:
   - Click the **Export** button in the top-left corner of the Supabase interface.
   - Choose the desired format (e.g., CSV, JSON) and save the exported file.
2. Use exported data for analysis, backup, or sharing as required.

### 7. Best Practices
#### **Avoid Direct Changes**
- Make changes through the Salawat Dashboard wherever possible to maintain data consistency.
- Direct database edits should only be performed for emergency fixes or advanced configurations.

#### **Backup Before Changes**

#### **Maintain Data Security**

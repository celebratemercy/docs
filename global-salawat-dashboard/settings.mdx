## Introduction

The Settings page enables you to configure key parameters for managing pledges, donations, and general application settings for the Global Salawat Challenge. This guide will help you understand each setting and how to adjust it according to your requirements.

## Features

### Navigation within Settings

- On the left side of the **Settings** page, there are four sections for specific settings:
    - **General Settings**: Configure the main application limits and sponsor information.
    - **Pledge Settings**: Adjust settings related to pledge submissions (not shown in detail here).
    - **Donation Settings**: Customize settings related to donations (not shown in detail here).
    - **Country Settings**: Manage country-specific settings (not shown in detail here).

### 1. **General Settings**

- This section, displayed by default, contains fields that control the main parameters for pledges and Salawat limits, as well as sponsor information. Here’s how to configure each setting:
    - **Total Pledges allowed per email**: Set the maximum number of pledges that can be made from a single email address. This helps prevent spam or misuse by limiting repeated entries.
    - **Total Salawat allowed per email**: Define the maximum number of Salawat (prayers) that can be pledged from a single email address. This is useful for controlling high pledge numbers from individual users.
    - **Total Salawat allowed per day for unique IP**: Specify the maximum number of Salawat that can be pledged per day from a unique IP address. This helps prevent excessive entries from a single IP.
    - **Total pledges allowed per day from unique IP**: Set the maximum number of pledges that can be submitted per day from a unique IP address. This ensures that no IP address is used to bypass pledge limits.
    - **Sponsor Name**: Enter the name of the sponsor, if any, associated with the Salawat challenge. This name may appear in public-facing parts of the application or reports.
- **Save Changes**: After making adjustments, click the **Save Changes** button to apply the updated settings. Make sure to save each time you update any setting to ensure changes take effect.

# SOP for Requesting Shipping Labels

## Overview

This SOP outlines the process for requesting shipping labels, primarily used for shipping inventory back to the warehouse after conferences or transferring materials between locations. Leveraging the warehouse's shipping label system ensures cost efficiency by using negotiated rates.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all employees needing shipping labels for conference inventory returns or other logistical needs requiring warehouse involvement.

## Responsibilities

* **Requestor**: Provides all necessary information to the warehouse team for label creation.

* **Warehouse Team**: Generates shipping labels and coordinates pick-up if requested.

## Requirements

* Access to Slack or email to communicate with the warehouse team.

* Accurate shipping details including addresses, package dimensions, and weight.

## Process

### 1. Determine the Need for a Shipping Label

* Identify if the shipment is for:

  * **Returning inventory from a conference** (e.g., conference in PDX).

  * **Transferring materials from a teammate or third-party location to the warehouse**.

* Confirm the purpose and destination of the shipment.

### 2. Prepare Shipment Details

Collect the following information:

* **Purpose**: Clearly specify the reason for the shipment (e.g., conference name or tag).

* **Pickup Address**: Location where the package will be picked up.

* **Delivery Address**: Destination for the shipment (e.g., warehouse address).

* **Order Number or Reference Tag**: Include for tracking purposes if applicable.

* **Package Dimensions**: Length, width, and height of the box.

* **Estimated Weight**: Provide an accurate or close estimate of the package weight.

### 3. Communicate with the Warehouse Team

* Use **Slack** for efficient communication or **email** if Slack is unavailable.

* Send the following information to the warehouse team:

  * Purpose of shipment.

  * Pickup and delivery addresses.

  * Order number or reference tag.

  * Package dimensions and weight.

* Specify if a **pickup request** is required or if you will handle the drop-off.

### 4. Receive and Apply Shipping Labels

* The warehouse team will respond with the shipping labels.

* **Download** the labels and **print** them.

* Attach the labels securely to the boxes.

### 5. Coordinate Shipment Pickup or Drop-Off

* If a pickup is requested, confirm arrangements with the warehouse team.

* If no pickup is needed, drop off the labeled package at a local FedEx or UPS location, depending on the service being used.

### 6. Follow-Up and Confirm Delivery Details

* Ensure the shipment is processed as intended.

* If the shipment is arriving at the warehouse, **create a Purchase Order** in the system to notify the warehouse team of the incoming delivery. This allows them to prepare for stocking the items appropriately.

* Track the shipment using the provided tracking number if available.

## Notes

* Use the warehouse system to reduce shipping costs compared to local shipping services.

* Ensure all details are accurate to avoid delays or additional charges.
